=======
this project's main target is to solve a special problem in mortor design.
When we design a stator of motor, we need to make sure the parameter like thickness,the diameter and the number of holes. Different
parameters will cause different reuslt. we need to design many times to make get a best arrangement of parameter for the best reuslt.

But now, we can use this software to simplify our workflow, and make you pay much more attention on the design rather than on modify
paramerters again and again.
